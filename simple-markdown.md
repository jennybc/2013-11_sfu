Title (header 1, actually)
=====================================

This is a Markdown document.

## Medium header (header 2, actually)

It's easy to do *italics* or __make things bold__.

> All models are wrong, but some are useful. An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem. Absolute certainty is a privilege of uneducated minds-and fanatics. It is, for scientific folk, an unattainable ideal. What you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while. We cannot expect anyone to know anything we didn't teach them ourselves. Enthusiasm is a form of social courage.

Code block below. Just affects formatting here but we'll get to R Markdown for the real fun soon!

```
x <- 3 * 4
```

I can haz equations. Inline equations, such as ... the average is computed as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$. Or display equations like this:

$$
\begin{equation*}
|x|= 
\begin{cases} x & \text{if $xâ‰¥0$,} \\\\
-x &\text{if $x\le 0$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$
