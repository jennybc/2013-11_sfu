R Markdown rocks
=====================================

This is an R Markdown document.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
head(x)
```

See how the R code gets executed and a representation thereof appears in the document? `knitr` gives you control over how to represent all conceivable types of output. In case you care, then average of the `r length(x)` random normal variates we just generated is `r round(mean(x), 3)`. Those numbers are NOT hard-wired but are computed on-the-fly. As is this figure. No more copy-paste ... copy-paste ... oops forgot to copy-paste.

```{r}
plot(density(x))
```

Note that all the previously demonstrated math typesetting still works. You don't have to choose between having math cred and being web-friendly!

Inline equations, such as ... the average is computed as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$. Or display equations like this:

$$
\begin{equation*}
|x|= 
\begin{cases} x & \text{if $xâ‰¥0$,} \\\\
-x &\text{if $x\le 0$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$
