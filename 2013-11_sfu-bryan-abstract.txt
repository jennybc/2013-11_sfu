Talk at SFU Friday November 29, 2013

Title: Reproducible research, open science, and all that good stuff
for people who use R to do stats

There is a huge buzz these days around changing practices in all
aspects of data analysis. I will go over some recent exciting
developments that are particularly relevant for the statistics
community, especially for users of R. We'll talk about R Markdown, the
knitr package, handy features of the RStudio IDE, and Git(Hub). And
how to get all of these things working together! The first 45 minutes
will be a somewhat conventional talk, perhaps with some demos, with
many opportunities for questions and discussion. Then we will have
about an hour for a short hands-on workshop for anyone who can bring a
laptop and wants to try these things out! Keep your eyes open for
forthcoming instructions about what to install in advance.
